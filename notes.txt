This is a small doc for quick lookup of commonly used git commands that i made for myself for work related stuff. Sharing on this forum hoping it helps:
1. To add new files to the git repository : git add <file_name>
2. To commit or to update changes to an existing file : git commit -m "<commit_message>" <file_name>
3. To upload all local branch commits to github : git push <origin> <master>
4. To download a repository that already exists on github : git clone <git_clone_URL>
5. To change the user name and email id that is displayed during a commit
change it in : git config --global -e and save the changes there
6. Branches are an important part of git and any changes/commits you make will be made
to the branch your currently checked out to.
7. To check which branch your currently checked out to : git status and check what all files you have not committed.
8. To create a new branch : git branch <branch_name>
9. To switch to a specified branch and update the current working directory: git checkout <branch_name>
10.To download the history from all remote tracking branches: git fetch
11.To merge the changes
